# TI-Programs
This is a collection of TI-BASIC programs I wrote in my childhood, the earliest of which being from around age 12, though some may be earlier because the only way I have to tell is from dates I left myself.

The files are organized into folders according to which of the 3 calculators they were on (yes I actually owned multiple graphing calculators), so there may be duplicates of programs I decided were worth transferring.

Files with the extension 8xp are Texas Instruments' own proprietary binary format, which may be useful for you if you wish to load them into a calculator. Files with the txt extension are the result of putting the 8xp file through [Source Coder 3](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/) (no affiliation) and copy/pasting the result verbatim.
